# PONG
PONG is a classic game where there two paddles. Two players control their own paddle and try to rebound the ball back to the other player in hopes of scoring a point. A point is scored when the other player fails to stop the ball.  
1. Player one - left side controls the paddle with the "w" for up and "s" for down.
   Player two - right side controls the paddle with the up arrow and down arrow. 
2. There is no limit on how long a player can play. Keep playing until you exit the game. 
3. To start the game - PRESS the letter "p"
4. To reset the game - PRESS the letter "a"
